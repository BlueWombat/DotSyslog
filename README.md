DotSyslog
=========

This library is designed to simplifi the process of sending log meessages from your own .Net application to a Syslog Server.

Integrating it is pretty basic, all you have to do is clone the repo, include the project in your solution, add a reference from your project to this project, and start using it, it's that simple.

Good luck with it:-)
