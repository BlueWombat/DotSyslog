DotSyslog
=========

A Syslog client implemented according to the RFC-3164 specification (The BSD syslog Protocol), see <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3164> for further reference.

This library is designed to simplifi the process of sending log meessages from your own .Net application to a Syslog Server.

Integrating it is pretty basic, all you have to do is clone the repo, include the project in your solution, add a reference from your project to this project, and start using it, it's that simple.

Everything is provided AS-IS under the GPLv3 license.

Enjoy:-)

P.S. Should you have any improvements, either start an issue, or fork it, and send me a pull request when you're done.
